# Hotel Managment System With C#

This project was developed as a part of the "Modern Web" module at the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM), Sri Lanka. The system is a comprehensive Hotel Management System designed specifically for Plaza Athenee Hotel to streamline their operations. It was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. The system allows efficient handling of core hotel functionalities such as room bookings, customer registrations, check-ins, check-outs, and billing. By integrating both frontend and backend technologies, the system provides an interactive user interface along with dynamic data processing, enabling hotel staff to manage reservations and customer details with ease and accuracy.
